# Cultivation Techniques (功法)

## Concept

Techniques are specialized physiological adaptations that refine and focus cultivation effects. Unlike raw cultivation power (which provides broad enhancements), techniques offer specific, targeted improvements in particular areas.

Techniques are not active abilities—they are permanent changes to how the body and spirit function, developed through understanding and practice.

## Philosophy

**"知行合一" — Knowledge and action are one.**

Techniques require two things: understanding (from manuscripts) and practice (from gameplay). Finding a manuscript gives you the knowledge, but the technique only reaches its potential through repeated use of its associated conditions.

This follows the traditional wuxia philosophy where martial arts mastery comes not from mere repetition, but from deepening comprehension of principles.

### Discovery vs. Development

**Discovery**: Finding a manuscript unlocks a technique at its most basic stage (Initiate). The body knows the theory but hasn't adapted.

**Development**: Using the technique's associated conditions (eating well, moving efficiently, surviving danger) advances it through stages of mastery.

This creates two layers of progression:
1. Exploration to find manuscripts
2. Gameplay to advance through stages

## Stage Progression

Techniques advance through five stages, inspired by traditional Chinese cultivation novel concepts (境界). The in-game interface uses English adaptations while the underlying philosophy draws from wuxia traditions.

### Initiate
*Wuxia equivalent: 入门 (Rùmén)*

**Basic understanding**

The technique barely manifests. Effects are unreliable, weak, and prone to failure. The practitioner is just beginning to grasp the fundamentals.

*"You know the movements, but your body does not yet understand."*

### Adept
*Wuxia equivalent: 小成 (Xiǎo Chéng)*

**Improved comprehension**

Effects appear more consistently, but still depend heavily on favorable conditions. Progress is visible, but mastery remains distant.

*"The technique responds, though not always as intended."*

### Accomplished
*Wuxia equivalent: 大成 (Dà Chéng)*

**Confident mastery**

The technique works reliably in most situations. The practitioner can depend on it under pressure. This is where most cultivators plateau.

*"Your body moves without conscious thought. The technique is becoming part of you."*

### Perfected
*Wuxia equivalent: 圆满 (Yuánmǎn)*

**Near-perfect mastery**

Almost full control with minimal side effects or failures. Only the most dedicated reach this stage.

*"There is nothing more to learn—only to perfect what you already know."*

### Transcendent
*Wuxia equivalent: 极境 (Jí Jìng)*

**Perfect mastery**

Complete unity of body, mind, and technique. The technique feels like a natural extension of the self, indistinguishable from instinct.

*"The technique is no longer something you do. It is something you are."*

## Current Techniques

### Efficient Energy Absorption
*"Channel excess calories into accelerated healing and recovery."*

**Focus**: Converting caloric surplus into healing power

**Advancement Conditions**:
- Maintaining calorie surplus
- Healing from injuries while well-fed
- Recovering muscle stiffness

**Effects** (scale with stage):
- Increased muscle recovery speed
- Faster wound healing
- Enhanced health regeneration

At Initiate, excess calories provide minimal healing benefit. At Transcendent, nearly all surplus energy is directed toward recovery.

---

### Movement Economy
*"Reduce energy expenditure through refined movement."*

**Focus**: Efficient physical motion

**Advancement Conditions**:
- Endurance must stay above 90% (highly efficient movement)
- Must be physically active (moving, running, fighting)
- NOT counted when: in vehicle, sleeping, sitting, resting, reading
- Bonus XP from zombie kills (efficient combat)

**Effects** (scale with stage):
- Reduced stamina consumption
- Slower fatigue accumulation
- Extended operational endurance

Represents a shift from explosive, wasteful movement to methodical, conserved motion.

### Energy Stabilization
*"Control the aura that draws the dead."*

**Focus**: Controlling zombie attraction from cultivation

**Advancement Conditions**:
- Surviving under zombie pressure
- Enduring proximity to many zombies
- Remaining calm in dangerous situations

**Effects** (scale with stage):
- Reduced zombie attraction radius
- Dampened energy emissions
- Better stealth despite high cultivation

High cultivation attracts zombies. This technique counteracts that cost, making power less burdensome.

## XP Mechanics

Each technique has unique advancement conditions tied to specific gameplay:

- **Efficient Absorption**: XP while maintaining calorie surplus
- **Movement Economy**: XP during sustained activity
- **Energy Stabilization**: XP under zombie pressure

XP is awarded automatically when conditions are met—no manual action required.

### Advancement Difficulty

Each stage requires more XP than the last:
- Initiate → Adept: Achievable within first few days
- Adept → Accomplished: Requires consistent practice
- Accomplished → Perfected: Significant time investment
- Perfected → Transcendent: Rare achievement, long-term goal

**Transcendent is designed to be:**
- Difficult to reach for any technique
- Potentially unattainable for all techniques in one playthrough
- A source of prestige and long-term motivation

## Manuscript System

### Finding Manuscripts

Manuscripts are scattered throughout the world:
- Rare spawns in bookshelves, libraries, offices
- Dropped by zombies (low chance)
- Found in specific location types

Each manuscript teaches one technique. Manuscripts are consumed upon learning.

### Learning Requirements

Some techniques require minimum cultivation levels:
- **Efficient Absorption**: Body level 2+
- **Movement Economy**: Body level 4+
- **Energy Stabilization**: Body level 6+

Finding a manuscript early means waiting until requirements are met.

## Design Philosophy

### Choice Through Discovery
Players cannot choose which techniques to learn—they must find manuscripts. This creates exploration incentive and playthrough variety.

### Choice Through Focus
Since techniques advance through different actions, players naturally specialize based on playstyle. Someone who eats well develops different techniques than someone who fights constantly.

### Refinement, Not Replacement
Techniques modify how cultivation works; they don't replace it. A technique at Transcendent stage without cultivation provides nothing.

### Wuxia Inspiration
The five-stage progression is inspired by traditional Chinese cultivation novels (xianxia/wuxia). While the interface uses English terms for accessibility, the underlying philosophy draws from concepts like "understanding over power" and meaningful mastery milestones.
