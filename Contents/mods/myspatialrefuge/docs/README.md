# My Spatial Refuge - Cultivation Survival Mod

## Philosophy & Lore

In this apocalyptic world, zombies are not merely reanimated corpses—they contain a mysterious energy, perhaps residual life force twisted by whatever caused the outbreak. Survivors who fight these creatures in close combat begin to absorb this energy, transforming their bodies and minds beyond normal human limits.

This is not a power fantasy where players become immortal gods. Instead, it's a gradual enhancement that makes survival *easier*, but never *trivial*. The zombie apocalypse remains dangerous. The cold still bites. Hunger still gnaws. But those who cultivate their bodies and spirits through adversity gain an edge—enough to survive another day.

### Core Themes

**Transformation Through Combat**
The body grows stronger by absorbing zombie energy through melee combat. Each kill is a small step toward physical transcendence.

**Wisdom Through Suffering**
The spirit is tempered not through victory, but through enduring hardship. Pain, fear, and exhaustion forge mental fortitude.

**Mastery Through Practice**
Techniques are not gifted—they are earned through understanding and refined through repetition. Knowledge without practice is hollow.

**Power Has Cost**
Greater cultivation attracts zombie attention. Magical storage requires rare materials. Every advantage demands sacrifice.

## Core Systems

The mod is built on interconnected systems that reward different playstyles while maintaining survival challenge.

### [Body Cultivation](./systems/body-cultivation/README.md)
Physical transformation through combat. Kill zombies in melee to absorb their energy and enhance your body. Benefits include reduced hunger, faster healing, and supernatural endurance.

### [Spirit Cultivation](./systems/spirit-cultivation/README.md)
Mental fortification through adversity. Endure stress, pain, and fear to strengthen your spirit. Benefits include panic immunity, stress resistance, and unshakeable mental clarity.

### [Cultivation Techniques](./systems/techniques/README.md)
Specialized abilities learned from ancient manuscripts. Techniques focus and refine cultivation effects, allowing players to specialize in healing, efficiency, or stealth.

### [Spatial Refuge](./systems/spatial-refuge/README.md)
Magical storage crafted from zombie cores. The Spatial Sack holds items with zero weight and prevents food spoilage—a cultivator's most practical tool.

### [Exercise Enhancement](./systems/exercise-enhancement/README.md)
Physical training amplifies cultivation. Performing fitness exercises grants temporary XP multipliers, rewarding players who prepare their bodies before combat.

## Design Principles

### Gradual Power Curve
Players start weak and become noticeably stronger over time. Early levels provide quick hooks; late levels reward long-term dedication.

### Meaningful Choices
Resources are limited. Cores spent on storage can't upgrade weapons. Time spent exercising could be spent fighting. Every decision matters.

### Integration, Not Replacement
Cultivation enhances vanilla mechanics rather than bypassing them. A master cultivator still needs shelter, still needs tools, still respects the horde.

### Extensible Foundation
The technique system, crafting system, and progression mechanics are designed for easy expansion. New content can be added without restructuring existing systems.
